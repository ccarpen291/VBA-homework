Rice University Homework #2 -- VBA

VBA code that cycles through stock data to provide max, min, % changes, and total volume traded per year.  Additionally, provides a few max summaries on the right hand side of the script.

Please note, all you have to do is open the script, and run.  It does not need to be on any specific sheet at the start.  It will automatically direct to the first and end on the last

Thanks,
